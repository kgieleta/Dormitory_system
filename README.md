# Dormitory Visit Management System

A web application project developed as part of a university subject, enabling dormitory residents to schedule visits, extend their duration, and allowing administrators and council members to manage these visits.  
The system includes a full login and registration mechanism, role-based authorization, a meeting calendar, as well as an admin panel for managing users and generating reports. The project was carried out in a 6-person team.
